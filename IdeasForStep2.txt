To get a list of objects, will take a histogram of all the captions of the flickr dataset and pick the nouns off of it. Use NN for nouns? 
Want to somehow assign so that words that mean the same thing aren't BOTH given teh same classification. Like woman and girl.

For now, just pick all the classes above a certain threshold.
